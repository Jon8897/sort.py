-   ### User guide

    1. Download file as a zip in the code section. then you will need to unzip the file.
    
    2. File must be added into the folder of the program so it will be able to read the file. 
        
    3. Within using the sort program is making sure line 7 and 8 have the same names as the file you wish to use for example: pyhtontestdata.csv is the current name, you will need to change this to the file name you have such as data.csv so the pyhtontestdate.csv would need to be removed.

    4. You will need to open the terminal and write the command -(python sort.py). This will then run the program and give you and output csv file depending on how big the file is the time of finish would vary, and in the terminal you can see what number the program is on.

    4. Once program is done go into folder and get the output.csv file and rename and upload it where you need.

-   ### Future upgrades

    1. GUI will need to be add for more user friendly usage 

    2. Program needs faster running time
